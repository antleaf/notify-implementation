# COAR Notify Implementation project
This a project to coordinate efforts from a distributed group of people and organisations to implement the [COAR Notify model and technologies](https://www.coar-repositories.org/notify-repository-and-services-interoperability-project/)

While individual projects and groups will manage their own implementations, this project serves as a central resource to gather and share common implementation issues.

Most of the resources and information can be found in the [wiki for this project](https://github.com/antleaf/notify-implementation/wiki)

## Notify Technical Implementation Group (TIG)
The development of this resource is supported and advised by the [Notify Technical Implementation Group (TIG)](https://github.com/antleaf/notify-implementation/wiki/Technical-Implementation-Group)
